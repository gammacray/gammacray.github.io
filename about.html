  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
I've always had a hard time describing myself. I'm not shy but I'm definitely introverted. I've lived a colorful life and I've traveled a lot of hard miles. I'm writing as therapy, as social outreach, and as livelihood. Please contact me if you read something you love, if something doesn't sit well with you... or if you find any speeling mistaks.<br>
<br>
This is a new project for me. I think of it as all the things I'd like to say around people but can't or never would. A lot of it is dark, unsavory, and cathartic. My hope is that at least some of it carries some hope for others. I hope I didn't con you into coming here to read a list of complaints. <br>
