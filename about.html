  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
I've always had a hard time describing myself. I'm not shy but I'm definitely introverted. I've lived a colorful life. I've put on a lot of hard miles. I'm taking up writing as therapy, as social outreach, and hopefully as livelihood. Please contact me if you like something you see, or if something doesn't sit well with you... or if you find any speeling mistaks.
