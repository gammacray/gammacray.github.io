  <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to the page where I describe myself in a few paragraphs, and cajole you into supporting my work. Strap in and take some notes because I’m gonna show you how an About Me page is done kid. Like a boss.</p>
<h1 id="whats-the-point-of-this-site">What’s the point of this site?</h1>
<p>I’m writing as therapy, as social outreach, and as livelihood. I’m writing in the spirit of mutual aid, honesty, recovery, growth. Please contact me if you read something you love, if something doesn’t sit well with you… or if you find any speeling mistaks. I welcome your feedback.</p>
<br>
<p>In one word, this project is about <em>change</em>. The universal quality of all phenomena. The cause of - and solution to - all our suffering and pain. Also needed to do laundry, and use the damn shopping cart at Superstore. No, I’m not doing this site to go on and on about philosophy, spirituality, or the state of humankind. No solutions here, only stories. Change is the heart of this work in the sense that <em>I have</em>, and <em>am</em> and will <em>continue to</em>. I’d like to share in the process of change with you. Let’s do it together amirite highfive?</p>

<p><em>Knowing nod. Tip of the hat.</em></p>
<h1 id="disclosure">Disclosure</h1>
<p>I’m an adult survivor of childhood emotional neglect and abuse, as well as sexual assault, addiction, and homelessness. I’m a mental health disaster to be honest - diagnosed C-PTSD and other stuff related to trauma and anxiety. My disorder bingo card is pretty full. I’ve been in therapy for coming up on two years, but should’ve been for the past twenty. I’ve lived a colorful life and traveled a lot of hard miles. I’ve had some very rough experiences but I try not to let them define me.</p>
<br>
<p>My hope is that I can share some elements of the above with you in ways that help grow our mutual empathy and compassion. I do my best not to engage in pure catharsis or defeatist mental masturbation, nobody needs to see that. The line blurs though, sometimes. On the daily I look for meaning in my life, past, experiences, setbacks, and also my wins. I often have to work extremely hard at finding the positive, and I know I’m not unique in that challenge. We’re all <em>in progress</em> and that’s okay.</p>
<br>
<p>I identify as <em>neurodiverse</em>. My pronouns are he/him/hey you. My alter ego’s name is Blammo and he’s a psychedelic clown from outer space - an agent of good trouble, cellular level sarcasm, and fine chaos. I write semi-anonymously under the name Gamma Cray so that people I don’t like can’t find my stuff and try to contact me.</p>
<br>
<p>I’ve participated in workshops and training with Mental Health First-Aid, Psychedelic First-Aid, <em>actual</em> First-Aid, and Crisis Intervention. More to come. Please feel free to reach out to me if you’d like to talk.</p>

<div style="background: ghostwhite; font-size: 20px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid lightgray; margin: 10px;">I acknowledge that I live, work and play on unceded land of the Snuneymuxw Nation, Coast Salish Territory.</div>
<h1 id="support-me-if-you-want">Support me if you want</h1>
<p>I’ve traditionally had a hard time asking for help, but I’m getting old. Life’s too short to hold out on ourselves and each other, so I’m officially over this hangup. Please consider contributing to my trip, help me grow as an artist, friend, and human. Let’s get healthier and happier together. Some ways to do that;</p>

<p>If you decide to buy me a coffee or become a monthly patron, I assure you that I can stretch a dollar. After living out of a backpack for over 20 years I’ve taken frugality to impossible extremes. I’m kinda proud of that in the context of this over-consumptive capitalist dumpster fire we’re all trying to make sense of. I won’t blow your resources on disposable or frivolous shit, I promise.</p>
