            <p>For those of us who grew up with abuse and/or neglect the odds are very high that we came out with either poor, or no, or <em>weaponized</em> boundaries. This is a function of inter-generational trauma. People with healthy boundaries are seldom (if ever) abusers.</p>

<h1 id="what-are-boundaries-anyway">What are boundaries anyway?</h1>

<p>Better writers than me have splained these things, so I won’t go too far into it here. Maybe another time. For this piece, a quote and a link to one of my favorite articles on them will do;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good boundaries are taking responsibility for our own actions and emotions, while NOT taking responsibility for the actions or emotions of others. Poor boundaries typically come in two flavors: those who take too much responsibility for the emotions/actions of others and those who expect others to take too much responsibility for their own emotions/actions.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, these two types of people often end up in relationships together.<br>

<p>One of the hardest pieces for kids raised by people with bad boundaries is we couldn’t (weren’t allowed or able to) assert our own, and we couldn’t <em>leave the situation</em> like we can (and should) as adults. This can obviously fuck us up hard when we get into the big world full of people with a better handle on things. Personally I went so far the other way that I couldn’t <em>not</em> leave situations, for like 25 years. I’ve had to unlearn so many levels of the flight-type pattern just to stay in one place for a year… for the first time ever… this year.</p>

<p>Boundaries are like ad-blockers and anti-malware for our brains. If we have them installed right, they automatically filter out the viruses and shitty things people are constantly trying to sell us at any given time. We all know at least some folk who try to persuade us to take responsibility for their neuroses, mistakes, goals, thoughts or feelings. They may also try to sell us the idea that we’re broken or bad, and that they can fix us. The really narcissistic assholes push something akin to ransomware/data-hostage situations on us, locking up our egos and demanding endless emotional or social payoffs to regain access.</p>

<p>This dynamic can happen in families, romantic relationships, workplaces, and on a larger scale like advertising and political propaganda. We’re often beset on all sides by people and organizations trying to break through or push down our boundaries to sell us shit we don’t need or want. And - here’s the fun part - it might even be <em>us</em> doing the door-to-door salesperson of doom trip on others. If we have bad boundaries it’s extremely likely that we (at least sometimes) default to pushing our ‘stuff’ onto the people around us, and we may not even know we’re doing it. <img class="emoji" title=":frowning:" alt=":frowning:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f626.png" height="20" width="20"> <img class="emoji" title=":thumbsdown:" alt=":thumbsdown:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44e.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h1 id="its-okay-step-on-my-face-if-its-in-your-way">It’s okay, step on my face if it’s in your way</h1>

<p>One of the biggest breakthroughs I’ve had in recovery has been learning about codependent relationship traps. These go something like this; I meet someone who’s just as fucked up as I am and we both exclaim <em>loudly</em> that we’re “Doing the work!™”. Infatuation and trauma-bond burn fast and hot, followed almost immediately by codependent/abusive dynamics, followed by militant reactivity and shenanigans, ultimately ending in gory explosions and all-out social media blocking wars. Good times. These fun relationships have all the sustainability of family-of-origin mixed with a more grown-up approach of <em>I’ma get mine</em>.</p>

<p>Again, the above happens in all areas of relationship - work, romance, etc. Ask me how many times I’ve worked for or with <em>friends</em> and then seen the dynamic go thermonuclear within a matter of weeks. Actually, don’t ask. Anyway, I’ve come to realize how many levels I had weaponized my boundaries (made them extremely rigid, razor-wired, and <em>armed to the fucking teeth mang</em>) so that I couldn’t or wouldn’t connect with <em>anyone</em> unless it was on my terms. I ended up making isolation a lifestyle, and I got really fucking good at it, because obviously nobody healthy wants to get into situations with someone who can’t let go of the battlezone mentality. Bonus round; those who <em>are</em> open to connections like this are <em>also</em> mental-bazooka toting whackjobs. Weee!</p>

<p>It takes effort and skill to parse which shit belongs to us and which don’t, but when we practice on it for awhile it becomes much easier. Eventually it ‘just works’, like how an Operating System runs almost invisibly when it’s set up right. The important thing is that we can get better at this stuff with repetition, and by learning from others who have good Operating Systems. Personally I don’t trust anyone who isn’t at least a little familiar with Linux (because nix users know how to mix metaphors good, like I’m doing right now - high-five).</p>

<p>Important to note that having good boundaries ain’t gonna solve the PTSD trauma-brain thing, but they <em>are</em> one more good coping strategy that everyone can have. With good boundaries we don’t fall into as many toxic relationships or situations, thus we don’t re-traumatize ourselves or re-enact past shit so often. When our relationships improve (and when we know which ones to ditch), we have a lot more energy to put towards unpacking the other stuff we need to work on, and we’ll <em>probably</em> make some healthier allies to help with the slog.</p>

<p>Boundaries are among my favorite topics to think (and write) about in the context of coming from a shitty childhood, so I’m going to be posting a lot more on this stuff over the coming months. Personally I believe there should be a whole fucking curriculum on this area, starting at around 6th grade. A lot of us make it into our 30’s, 40’s, even 50’s not having a damn clue about this, which is crazy.</p>

<p>I’ll be writing whole posts about boundary related things that interest me, such as;</p>

<ul>
  <li>weaponized boundaries</li>
  <li>guilt trips</li>
  <li>the no-boundary game</li>
  <li>moving boundaries</li>
  <li>codependency</li>
  <li>shyness as a form of aggression</li>
  <li>how to learn boundaries by watching Rick &amp; Morty</li>
  <li>how to learn boundaries by watching The Office</li>
  <li>how to write long lists about nothing</li>
  <li>how to take a joke/bit too far</li>
  <li>how to <em>really</em> stretch it out</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. That’s the post. Thanks for reading, and as always please feel free to contact me for any reason at all (unless you’re one of my stalkers from the past, then you can fuck right off. See what I did there? I just threw up a boundary!)</p>
