# Katherine brought up a good point yesterday

She's right. If I had been a woman, all these years, people would've fucking *tripped all over themselves* to get me the help I needed. I was the victim of a violent sexual assault when I was 16. Two men in their 30's drugged and raped me over multiple days. 

I didn't tell anyone for quite a few months after it happened, but eventually I broke down and disclosed to a female friend that I trusted, and I've regretted that decision all my life. Not only did it not help, it hurt more than the actual experience ever could've.

Within a week she had told her younger sister, who went to my highschool. A week after *that* I was being bullied and called faggot (their words). I started getting invited to parties and then beaten up. Mocked. Fucked with. People were afraid of or openly hostile towards me.

I was already struggling to fit in for years prior to that, because of the abuse at home and my inability to cope with it effectively. I was already an outcast. About three months after I disclosed, I quit school and left town for good. My community had turned on me, what the fuck else could I do?

My point? 

Even as recently as the past two years, applying for disability and starting therapy and working with advocates for the first time ever... I've disclosed to at least a dozen people face-to-face (and probably a dozen more have seen my detailed written applications behind the scenes).

*Nobody* told me about things like the Crime Victim's Assistance Program in my region. *Nobody* offered to help me find funding for more intensive modes of therapy not available in the public system. I want to re-iterate that if I were a woman, I doubt very much that 25 people would've heard me disclose something like that and just shrug and go 'huh'. 

There's a lot of change happening lately around all this, but there's a lot more to go.
