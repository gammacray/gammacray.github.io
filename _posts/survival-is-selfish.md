# Survival Is Selfish


Let's differentiate immediately between someone walking down the street who finds a lost wallet full of money - who has their own wallet full of money in their back pocket.... Obviously this person is not in a survival situation in the context of money. They'll turn the whole thing in, happily. Same scenario but I haven't eaten in a couple days, I'm on the street living out of a backpack - I reason that the person won't miss 50 bucks but will be glad to have their ID and credit cards back. (And let's parse this further to exclude the person who takes it all, realizing that there's a good market for stolen credit cards.......... I'm not one of those people and I doubt most people reading this are either).

I wanna be clear, I'm *not* talking about survival on a community level where the village comes together to make sure everyone's more or less taken care of. In this piece I'm talking about the traumatized individual kid. Those of us who were abused, neglected, lost, and fucked with who ultimately ended up fully isolated from community and totally unable to connect with it.

When we spend our youth (and often adulthood) literally scraping by, surviving in it's nastiest sense, without real connection or relationship to help us along or smooth the hardest parts - *we don't fucking think about anyone else*.

It's not often intentional, but when we've spend years or decades living on next to nothing and without help, we don't think about things like;

* gifts
* birthdays
* special occasions
* etc
* etc

It's pretty fucking alien to us to frame generosity or altruism when we don't even have enough for ourselves. Living on less has become a lifestyle, and we're so depleted in every way at almost all times that it becomes practically anathema to give any of it away *even if we do run into abundance occasionally*.

The very nature of the feast and famine cycle that most of us get stuck in dictates that even when we're experiencing a feast, *we know the famine is coming*. It always does. And it's always coming *soon*. 

People stuck in this cycle often come off selfish, aloof, and maybe even stingy or lazy. And you know what? This is accurate. We fucking are selfish. Because we've had to rely on *ourselves* for everything all the way down to emotional support since we were *way too young to have been doing it*.
