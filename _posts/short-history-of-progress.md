# Tools become weapons become tools become trauma

Since agrarian days, armed guards outside the grain bins and the elite figuring out ways to starve the village into doing things against their own well-being, trauma has been mainstream.

In the centuries since then, the powerful *have* understood that traumatized people pushed indefinitely into the fawn state are good subjects of rule. Even the flight and fight types are okay - migrant workers and soldiers. *If they can direct it well*.

The thing here is... traumatized populations that might function well *economically* on a large scale produces traumatized *individuals* who may not. And those individuals - party time - traumatize those below them. 

Enter; us.

I'm guessing the breakdown of communities, at some point, hurt the bottom line for the elite. *Wild* guess. Like ah, ahem, cough cough.... 2020. This is not boding well for the mega-mansion owning billionaires who haven't paid taxes since the 80's. Trickle down *my fucking ass*.

Anyway. 

Some quotes from this book, some ties to actual science and psychology, and a few more humorous jabs at the folk who think holding a planet at gunpoint is a fun way to get their (non) needs met at our expense. Generationally, something's gotta give. 

You might've gotten away with it in my great-great-grandparents age, but you're fucking done here now, kid. Fuck yourself Elon.
