# Brains ping memories to keep them alive...

This is a normal function of the human brain. In meditation circles we call it 'monkey brain'... the mind swinging randomly from memory branch to branch, disjointed thoughts and feelings arising and falling away. It's pretty much crazy stuff that makes no sense... but it serves a purpose.

Our brain is constantly randomly accessing the memories stored in it. It does this to keep pathways and connections alive (so that we can access those memories all these years later) and to integrate new ideas and experiences, form new pathways, on and on. It's a natural process.

Let's say in a given year our brain randomly accesses old stuff 3 times, to keep it organized and fresh for later use.

Let's say the average person has about 20% shitty memories. So over a year, about 20% of their recollections will be negative and cringey.

Now let's say us trauma kids have something like 60 or 70% shitty memories (and let's not forget that the original traumas probably opened the door for us to generate *a lot more* subsequent traumas)...

So okay, it's simple math. If upwards of 70% of our randomly accessed memories are fucked up and awful, we're gonna have a bad time of it. Barring any other discussion about how well 'processed' those memories are, *they exist* and our brain randomly regurgitates them throughout the year to *keep them fresh*.

Among all the other things going on for us... if a normal 'healthy-ish' person experiences less than half of their memories as painful whereas us trauma kids experience *over* half of our memories as suffering, we're *obviously* gonna struggle with things that they don't. 

Then let's get into the amygdala and auto-immune disorders and doom spiralling lack of social connection etc etc etc.

See that?

Just the numbers, alone, are a thing.
