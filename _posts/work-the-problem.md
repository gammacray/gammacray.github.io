# Work the problem - punch inner critic in the fucking face

I've realized that it's *not* that I don't know how to ask for help... it's that I *do* know from experience that asking for help most often leads to pain. It's that I *asked the wrong fucking people for help* thousands of times, and that's why I stopped doing it.

There are a lot of levels to why we don't know how to fucking get support.

When I need help, I just fucking self-destruct instead. Because that's where my brain short circuits. It's not just childhood baggage, this problem has been with me through adulthood too. I've often been mocked, bullied, dumped, and fired *for needing help*. Yes... all of those cases were *relationships with shitty people*.... which *does* go back to childhood. I *learned* to attach to shitty people, who don't or won't help when asked. Because we're all codependent fuckups.

So.................. HEY ISOLATION! HOW *YOOOOOO* DOIN?
