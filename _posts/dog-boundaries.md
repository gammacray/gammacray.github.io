# here's a mindfuck boundary style

You know that thing your dog does to get your attention, to let you know that they want something, and you do it even though you don't feel like it *because they're a cute helpless fucking dog?* Yeah........ so that's you having shitty boundaries.

And your dog just hustled you.

And they'll do it again. And again. AAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNDDDDDdd again.

Because they have you trained.

Dogs are awesome practice at boundaries. 

Aggression (as in asserting your boundaries) is not the same thing as anger or hostility. And with dogs (who understand and communicate with aggression) you actually have a fucking *invaluable* opportunity to practice your boundaries with them. 

You ever notice that you can get angry with your dog and they still love you? Yeah.... that's why a lot of us hang out with dogs over people. Fact.
