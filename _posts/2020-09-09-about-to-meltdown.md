Does anyone else start losing their dexterity and co-ordination when things are about to get crazy? I get that a lot. I'm often feeling flat or disengaged but I don't notice it until something slips out of my fingers and hits the floor or the counter *and then I fucking lose it*. 

# Wish I could drop beats the way I drop my progress

Boom.

I've started paying more attention to my emotional state if I *almost* drop something. I usually have pretty good sense for where things are, and where I am in relation to them. I keep a fairly tidy space. I rarely lose things. But all that goes away when I'm triggered or hyper-vigilant.

In the case of getting clumsy, I wonder if it's a lack of mindfulness that *turns into* a trigger event. For me, by the time the event has progressed to the point of losing contact with my fingers it's usually too late to stop it. I've tried a lot of breathing techniques to bring myself back from that edge, but ironically when I try to apply more focus and mindfulness to my body when I'm already agitated it tends to make it worse, not better. I think that's because focusing on the agitation makes it that much more intense, which ends up overloading me.

There's definitely a case for mindfulness, but let's not forget that there's also a case for distraction or redirection when that's appropriate. I'd rather binge a series than punch myself in the face or scream insults at myself full-volume. Obviously. Anything I can do to avoid that, I'll take it.
