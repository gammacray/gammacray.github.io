# Boomers vs X'ers vs Millenials vs Zoomers vs whoever the fuck

I wanna say that as an X'er, being accused of being 'just as bad as boomers' makes me fucking laugh. As though I didn't come up under the dumbass boomer ideals. As though I wasn't crushed by the 'greatest generation' who were crushed *by the one that came before them* ad infinitum. 

We had satanic panic, a decade of do-gooders banning music and books and fucking *teletubbies*. Grow up kids. We were there for the birth of the modern prison industrial complex and militarized policing. We were on the front lines of pushing back against branding and sweatshop labor. We didn't have the internet, we had fucking hardcopies of *Adbusters* and we had to skate down to the store to pick it up and read it.

What am I getting at here?

Yes. A lot of my generation sold out, became exploitative assholes just like their parents. Yep! It happens. Here's the rub *chilren!* Some of *you* are gonna sell out too! Your generation is going to make mistakes, some of you will get jaded, and some of you are already greedy sociopaths.

Why would I waste a bunch of words on this topic?

Because I want to touch on something that I see people forgetting all the time, in *all* generations. It's this; healthy community includes people from all age groups, all walks of life, all genders, etc etc. A truly vibrant and thriving community is *not* a fucking monoculture of snarky 20-somethings. My generation tried the same shit... 20 years ago. We wanted to place all blame and responsibility for how fucked thing were *onto everyone else* and it didn't work. We started taking some fucking initiative, we got out there, we connected with other people who were doing the same. And oh PLOT TWIST; those we found doing the work were from *everywhere on the spectrum*. 

It's always been like that, and always will be.

We need *everyone* to get some shit done. Find the good ones. Leave the rest behind. It's not an age thing and (shocker) you're gonna get old too.
