# I don't mean to be the villain... but I'm pretty good at it

When the abuse started at home, I genuinely didn't deserve it. I was shoved into the role of black sheep, scapegoat, 'the one who would fuck up so bad that my stepfather would lose his job and we'd all end up homeless on the streets.'

I was 12. Getting straight A's. On several sports teams. (Oh and I was just starting to discover punk music.)

It was decided for me the first time - that I was the antagonist of my family's story. It crushed me, to be honest. It was so fucking outta nowhere. I *now* realize a lot of where that came from (he was threatened by me, he was a first-time parent with my infant half-brother).

Point of this piece; when you're in the role of antagonist and then *push back* against that role, you're *still* the fucking antagonist but now you're fighting it (and cementing the thing in everyone else's minds... "only guilty people do things like that"). 

Later when I started acting out in school and elsewhere... I kept getting labeled. And then pushing back. And then labeled harder, and then pushing back harder. You see where this is going.

I've done some truly shitty things. In the depth of addiction I fucked up. Even before/since addiction, I've been lonely, desperate, selfish and self-destructive. Unkind. Mean. Surly. I've grown a hard fucking bark over the years, and that makes me the perfect cookie-cutter villain for a lot of people's stories. I'm a ready-rolled antagonist and I'm often *quickly* back in that seat the moment I try to join a community.

I'm no evil genius. I'm actually a very nice person. But if someone tries to slap that evil logo onto my actions from afar, the mask comes off. You wanna fucking villain asshole? I've done this before. It's on like donkey kong.
