# The recreational guilt trip - a lifestyle

What the fuck do I wanna write under this heading? Something about;

* abusers thrive on attention, and do really dumb and interesting things to get it
* clowny version about how we as abused emulate this bullshit even though we hate ourselves for it. GOOD TIMES
* on and on about the fucked up hilarious complexes we take on from a life of neglect, into the big bad world that doesn't even know we exist but MIGHT IF WE SUFFER ENOUGH IN AN OUTLANDISH WAY
