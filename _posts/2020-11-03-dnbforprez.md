I'm listening to some beautiful drum&bass as I watch Twitter for news of the US collapse today. It's an exciting time to be alive. 

I'm in my forties, my first protest was a G8 summit in the late 90's. I've always wondered if a true uprising would happen while I'm alive. I'm *not* excited to see people get hurt, but I *am* proud of so many millions of people taking their well being and safety and self-respect into their own hands.

Something's gotta give.


### What does that have to do with drum and bass?

Nothing really. But listen to this anyhow.
