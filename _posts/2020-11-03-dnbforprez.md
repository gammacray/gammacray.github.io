I'm listening to some beautiful drum&bass as I keep an eye on Twitter for news of the US empire collapsing today. It's an exciting time to be alive. 

**Something's gotta give.**


### What does that have to do with drum and bass?

Nothing, but listen to this anyhow. :laughing:

I'm in my forties. My first protest was a G8 summit in the late 90's. I went for what I thought would be chaos, and instead I fell in love with the family atmosphere and the true community connection feels.

Since that one, I've attended many actions large and small. I marched with 10+ million people (worldwide) in 2003 against the second US invasion of Iraq, and was part of a 24hr vigil that lasted over a month for the same anti-war cause. Unfortunately those actions had little effect on the outcome, as we all know almost 20 years - and millions of dead Iraqis - later.

I've always wondered if a true north American uprising would happen during my lifetime. It's been building awhile, that much is clear. I'm *not* excited to see people get hurt, but I *am* proud of so many millions of protesters taking their well being and safety and self-respect into their own hands. *Fuck police brutality, racism, and predatory capitalism.*

I could talk about how I became politicized by trauma and conservative values. Small-town life along with a dash of satanic panic and a heaping of emotional neglect and abuse fucked me up for half my life *and put a fierce hatred of abusive authority deep into my heart.*

I could talk about how leaving those communities and ending up on the road was the best *and* worst thing that ever happened to me. Out there I experienced anarchy, freedom, and forms of community I'd never known existed. I had some hard lessons out there *but I also learned how to hug on the road.*

I could talk about how modern oligarchy and capitalism are in the business of serving up destruction and trauma at rock bottom prices - every day. The people from my fucked up hometown (as well as my family of origin) are all victims of generations of toxic consumerist propaganda and messaging. *The people who hurt us are not 'survivors' of the apocalypse even though technically most of them are still alive.*


### Politicized by trauma

When I say I'm proud of all the protesters, I wanna be clear that I feel this rebellion against tyranny and authoritarianism in my marrow. I wish I could be out there. Pushing back against it is *needed*. I'm happy that I've lived to see it on this scale, both in the US and worldwide. Having said that...

I'd rather see our society motivated by compassion, empathy, trust, and community. My hope is that the outcome of 2020 is a more cohesive and tolerant north America. 

The polls are closing now. Protests are starting up. Let's see how it goes tonight. Be safe and ungovernable out there kids.
