# What are people with *no* boundaries like?

Here are the simplest flags. If you hear these phrases coming outta someone's mouth *all the fucking time* in response to questions like 'What do you wanna do for dinner tonight?' or 'Do you feel like going over to our friends' place?' etc. the odds are high that you have a 'no-boundary' person on your hands.

* I don't know
* I don't care
* Whatever
* Maybe
* It's up to you

These are their favorites, but there are dozens of variations on the same theme; **I don't take anything seriously and neither should you.**

The trap here is simple. By putting the responsibility on you to make all the decisions, that person is subtly positioning himself to take zero risk and place all outcomes squarely on your shoulders.

So if you decide indian food and it makes them sick? It's on you.

If you go to your friends' place and a bad time ensues? Guess who's at fault.

No boundary people come in different flavors. Some of them think nothing of walking around your space, picking shit up off the shelves and fondling them and then (weirdly) sliding them under the couch for you to find a month later. I dated a woman who thought nothing of throwing her dirty laundry into my backpack (full of clean clothes) instead of her own while we were traveling. And when I called her on it? *I was a control freak.*

There's not much you can do to assert your own boundaries with the no-boundary crew. They just don't fucking value the things - their own or others. They *do* get upset if theirs are crossed, but their boundaries are so vague and fuzzy and undefined that it's impossible for anyone but their most intimate people to even know where they begin. So in a way they're going around life pretending nothing bothers them, until something does - and then it's up to everyone else to figure out what the fuck it is because they have no clue and no way to communicate about any of it.

No-boundary people often think of themselves as free spirited, spontaneous, open minded. Which are all nice qualities. It gets tricky (annoying, exhausting) when they judge and look down on others for wanting some fucking personal space. The carefree give-a-fuck attitude for them becomes a virtue, *an ideal*, and they can't figure out why everyone wouldn't want their crusty panties wherever they feel like throwing them.
