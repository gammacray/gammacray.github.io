# Addicted to Cortisol

When we live years and decades constantly adrenalized and red-lining our brains, we actually grow dependent on those hormones and the mental states they create. Neuropathways form around this state of being and it can be incredibly hard to ween ourselves off this dependence. 

Though it sucks sometimes to be trapped in racing thoughts and a palpitating heart, there are other times that I for one *enjoy* the rush of feeling driven and excited beyond normal levels. In fact after years of living on/off, agitated/flat, hypervigilant/dead-eyed... obviously there are lots of scenarios when get-shit-done mode is far preferable.

The thing with recovery is learning how to get shit done without redlining our physiological and mental resources *all the time*. We need to learn how to turn that on and off at will, instead of having that system flip out randomly and at inopportune times.

Cortisol breaks down adrenaline. Cortisol is the hormone that tries to flip our body and internal systems back from hyper-aware survival mode back to stasis. The thing is, cortisol *also* breaks down tissue, and fucks with the immune system. When the adrenal system is firing and shutting down all the time, several times a day, for months or years at a time... we're so full of cortisol that our bodies start to suffer. We age faster. We get chronic inflammation and pain. Auto-immune disorders. Oh yeah and that little piece of being fucking miserable all the time - that's because it shuts down or otherwise fucks with our reward system - dopamine.

Dopamine is what we want more of.

I can't even tell you how many *thousands* of times my reward system has gone offline. In the old days I reached for hard drugs to activate it. In the years before that I did other risky shit. Even after I quit drugs, I used to double-fist coffee and chainsmoke cigarettes for 18 hours a day, just carpet surfing for a little crumb of endorphins left in the dimebag of my brain.
