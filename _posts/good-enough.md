# Some notes on Pete Walker and the 'good enough' thing

There's a bunch of bullshit flowing through our culture that perfection is not attainable but mandatory. When we work for people, *for money*, those motherfuckers *demand* perfection or you're pretty much fired. The attitude of 'good enough' will lose us a fucking job. We all know that.

So why do we settle for 'good enough' in relationship, or other areas of our lives? Well... it sucks but we have to. Because unlike framing a house or fully cooking a burger so that it doesn't kill the customer, people are fucking flawed and good enough is pretty much the best it's gonna get, ever.

It's hilariously depressing, actually. 

My 'good enough' is pretty fucking bad compared to most people I know, if I'm honest. My hygiene, my swearing, my social etiquette... I could keep going... are all pretty fucking sub-standard by most people's measure. Which, realistically, is *also* a huge part of why I'm isolated. There's a part to the isolation that I manufacture and choose for my own safety, but there's *also* the part where I don't fit in with the crowd and never have. Because I don't make the fucking cut. I'm not picked for the team. And you know what? That's a real thing - I'm not *good enough* to get the job, the second date, or invited back out with the crew.

There are areas where we're all *not* good enough. And that can fucking blow. 

I don't know where else I'm going with this. I love Pete's writing and concepts. He's right. When it comes to our recovery we need to be okay with 'good enough' days and 'good enough' health. We also have to accept those areas where we're not good enough, and figure out some other strengths to build on.

I guess I could look at it like this; since I'm not good enough to have a thriving social life, I get to spend years straight living like a shut-in and reading great books, and getting *good* at writing. Maybe that's the trade-off that I haven't *chosen* but I acknowledge it and embrace it anyhow. Because if I don't, I'm an asshole. I wouldn't be writing this hard if I were good at making easy money and blowing it all on coke. (Tried that, I sucked at it too).

Meh. Meh. Meh.

I just wrote half a piece when I should be looking for a movie to watch.

Fuck this shit.
