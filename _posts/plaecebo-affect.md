# When we're desperate enough for connection, EVERYTHING looks good - even abuse

This piece will probably write itself.

When we grow up with abuse and neglect, even monsters who give us affection or connection grab our attention and end up using it against us. And/or we start to mistake *acquaintances* for true connection. And/or we join a cult or a gang. And/or we fall in love with movie characters.

We can't help ourselves. 

We're hardwired for community, and having that shit cut short as young people doesn't kill the drive - only the tools we should've had to navigate it.
