# I just wanna write about it

What I have to deal with fucking pales in comparison, and I'd like to tease that out a bunch. Also the history of this phrase is rad, and more people need to know about it. Wetiko sufferers not only *bring* Wetiko where-ever they go, they fucking *are* Wetiko and they try to turn the rest of us into it as well.

Maybe the traumatized are *survivors* of Wetiko. Maybe we're so fucked up because we *didn't* get sick with it, and this life is kinda our immune response to it all. 

Just gonna roll some of that around.
