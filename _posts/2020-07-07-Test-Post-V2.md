Major Test. Winning at tests just means I'm the guy who wins all the time. Straight goods. Testing to see how much of this excerpt I'll end up seeing on the index page if I don't include a description in YAML header. Kinda wanna see more than just one truncated line under the post. 

* list
* lists are awesome
* I love lists

> Comment! Also wanna see how a longer comment renders. So far I'm really loving the way this site is laid out, and I love the fonts/design. I'm really pretty stoke.

Testing sync on save. It's working YESSA!

I'm pretty happy with this build. It's a really nice theme and I think I'm gonna stick with it. Because if I don't I'm gonna punch myself in the brain! :laughing: :thumbsup:
