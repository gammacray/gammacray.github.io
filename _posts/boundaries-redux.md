# Battle of the Boundaries Redux

Weaponized boundaries seem to be a response (personally at least) to having been vulnerable as a young person and then being ripped apart (taken as weak) by my peers. Unfortunately that pattern has repeated dozens of times through adulthood to reinforce the original injury (and subsequent coping strategy).

Ultimately, while I'm thorny and rigid on the outside, once someone gains my trust and I let them into my life, they usually find that I have TERRIBLE boundaries once inside my defences. This is obviously (to me at least) a function of seldom having good boundaries modeled for me... As well as seldom having anyone respect my own.

It's a vicious cycle.

I've WANTED to let more people in, for years I've worked at it (even before I started understanding or exploring what boundaries even are)... But at the end of the day I gotta admit that I don't fucking trust people. They've hurt me. A lot. I might even say - I think accurately on lots of levels - I've been hurt more than the average person has.

And here's the flip side; hurt people hurt people. And I've fucking hurt people, with my pain and desperation and self loathing and weaponized boundaries. And the more people I hurt, the less the community trusts me... And ultimately the less I trust MY OWN JUDGEMENT in interpersonal situations too. So... Higher go the walls, again. It's as much about keeping myself in as it's about keeping people out. I acknowledge that, fully.
