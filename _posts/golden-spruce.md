# Some comparison to cutting down our own sacred tree

When we're traumatized, sometimes we get so wrecked by life that we can act out in ways that are totally destructive and uncool, like the golden spruce.

We do it in misguided and desperate ways to try to send out a message, or reclaim ourselves, or whatever-the-fuck. It always makes sense to us at the time, from within our trauma-brains... even though most people just see a wingnut hurting themselves.

A lot of us never get access to the sacred. To put that another way, we *know* what's sacred to others and we fucking *crave* that for ourselves, but sometimes we don't get access to it because we don't know how to value something that much, and it fucking hurts. So maybe sometimes we cut it down, figuratively, to let ourselves and others know that we're out here too.

When that spruce fell, Haden was right! What would everyone value that beautiful fucking tree in the middle of a clearcut of its peers? He might've been nuts to do it, but his message was bang on.

I think a lot of us do this with our own lives, too. Like hey fuckers, you wanna talk about community and empathy and all this shit?! Look around you, there are *millions of us* broken and fucked up right in front of you, and instead you go to church or work and worship at the alter of *symbols*. Is that *really* the best place to put all your resources, effort, *love*?

I suck at the sentimental... and maybe that's my golden spruce. I've chopped a lot of fucking sentimental moments down, openly, defiantly, and self-destructively. I think there's something to this.

* curt's wedding
* any number of public speaking events
* jobs
* etc

Things that others hold sacred *that I'm not privvy to* aren't very safe in my vicinity. Sucks but true.
