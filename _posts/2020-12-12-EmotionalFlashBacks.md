> Emotional flashbacks are a complex mixture of intense and confusing reliving of past trauma from childhood. Like living a nightmare while you're awake, with overwhelming sorrow, toxic shame, and a sense of inadequacy. Filled with confusing and distressing emotions from the past, an emotional flashback is extremely painful. In my experience, an emotional flashback causes me to feel nuclear war is about to begin, or I am in extreme danger. It just feels like something horrible is about to happen.<br>

>I hear my inner critic repeating messages given to me in childhood calling me a loser, a nobody, a failure, and not a good person. These old tapes leave me without energy, and self-destructive.


# I want off the ride

I don't know why, but I've been melting down every day for a straight month. I've been doing everything I'm *supposed* to do; sleeping well, eating healthy, reading and watching uplifting content, applying for work, staying in touch with friends, laying off the cider. I even got a blender and I've been doing deep green smoothies every day. So wtf is going on? 

I've wondered if it's the holidays. I'm like a lot of folk from an abusive past, I don't do well this time of year. It's incredibly hard to watch other people connect with their loved ones and *enjoy* each other. Families get together and share fond memories and resources. I didn't really have that growing up. At holiday gatherings I watched my abuser turn into Mr. Rogers, the nicest guy you'd ever meet. I stayed as far away from him as possible and these were the rare times he left me alone because he wanted to make a good impression on my mom's side of the family. They all bought it, too.

I don't have the kind of stories most people tell about the holidays. 

Over the years I've been invited to holiday meals with friend's families, and while I've always appreciated the gesture I've often felt so uncomfortable and out of place that I stopped accepting. It's painful to show up the only single person, empty-handed, bug-eyed, stressed out, and awkwardly silent. 

Inevitably the questions 'What do you *do?*' and 'Where are you *from?*' make the rounds and I feel like running away screaming. If I can, I give one word answers. If I can't, I sometimes nervously explain that I haven't talked to my family in years and I'm too fucked up in the brain to work much. That kills the conversation very effectively. 


# Could be the meds

I haven't been taking my zooms.

I've realized that over the last six weeks I haven't been micro-dosing Psilocybin as I had been most of this year. Prior to November I had been dosing small amounts in tea once a week, but I had run out for awhile and after I reloaded I didn't really feel like dosing for some reason.

Last night I took a larger dose than usual for the first time in a month. It was rough, I was feeling very off yesterday and I rarely dose when I'm feeling bad because they tend to amplify the awful, not relieve it. And that's what happened, I spent four hours last night in psychedelic agony. But... it was worth it. I feel a hell of a lot lighter today. It wasn't *fun* but it was at least colorful.

I tend to try to take the medicine when I'm feeling able to meet it half way, which is why I haven't been dosing lately - I haven't had that kind of energy. But I finally just leaned into it yesterday and it's okay to feel bad sometimes. I need to remember that.

Anyway, I'm going to start dosing weekly again and track the results. If my mental well-being picks up drastically, that's proof of concept enough for me. I *know* psilocybin works for me, but this has been an accidental experiment to see exactly *how well*.
