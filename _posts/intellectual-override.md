Similar to how people who lose sight develop better hearing to compensate. When we lose access to our emotional lives, we have to compensate by developing other faculties to survive.

I have a *very* strong intellect, but I'm still disabled in the sense that I have extremely poor social and emotional tools to get by in the real world. Without good emotional regulation I'm unrelatable... and without the use of the emotions it takes me sometimes weeks to process things that a healthy emotional person can do in seconds. 

To healthy people, the need to 'overthink' things (as they call it) can be very off-putting. What's actually happening is we're trying to grind down problems with our brains that are *actually* issues that the emotions are meant to deal with. When we don't have access to those parts, we suffer.
