# Okay. Ear hair?

Can I tie this in with some wise/bullshit theme about how I've lived through all kinds of fucked up evolutionary mechanisms gone awry and then sit here and think 'I just punched myself in the face for the past month straight but what bugs me more is that ear hair after 40 serves *even less* evolutionary advantage than freaking the fuck out about things that happened 30 years go!'

I dunno. Maybe I can make it work.

Lean into it fuckface. Maybe there's something here.
