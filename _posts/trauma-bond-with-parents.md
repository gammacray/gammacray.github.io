* Ken was beaten with fenceposts and reminded me all the time
* Mom was def neglected emotionally for 8 kids and poverty
* both of their anxiety and fears came to bear on me - basically a stranger to them and both unwilling/unable to get to know me as a fucking individual
* my brother came up with three supportive people who didn't actually get along with each other... good times. At least he made it out kinda okay
