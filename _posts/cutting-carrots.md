# Cutting Carrots - Cutting Class - Cutting Myself

I don't know if this one's gonna fly, but it might be neat to run this memory through and try to put it down. 

I vaguely remember this as the time I was 12 or 13, just after they started accusing me of being a hard drug addict and (not so) secretly fearing that I was a satanist murderer. 

I remember this now, after decades of not thinking about it - and I realize that my mom was definitely along for that particular ride. She believed all that shit Ken was saying about me. She was in on it.

I always thought she had my back, but now I realize that she didn't and it was just remnants of the years prior that it was just her and I. I still *felt* like she had my back, but she really didn't.

*She actually thought I was going to stab her to death in the kitchen because she had asked me to help her make dinner.*
