# Suicidal Tendencies and Other Adventures

Some shit about having almost died by my own hand "accidentally" a couple dozen times over the years via things like asphyxiation, overdose, taking an adventure into *very too far* territory, knives held to my throat, almost impulsively driving into an oncoming train and/or traffic, unconsciously starting violence with *huge motherfuckers* and crazy people because I hated myself and wanted them to kill me... etc etc.

We don't always register the desire to die consciously, but our unconscious mind has some pretty fucked up ways to punish us when it doesn't feel like it's being heard. Negative self-talk and all those other complexes of self-hatred are not only uncomfortable, embarrassing, exhausting... they're also *dangerous*.
