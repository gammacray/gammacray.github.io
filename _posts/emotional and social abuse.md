# Emotional Abuse Needs to be Taken Seriously

I think of it like this. If an abusive parent were hitting their kid with fists or other blunt force objects, and caused a brain injury, they've be vilified and charged with a crime. Yet that same parent, with the absence of *physical* violence but who terrorizes and bullys that kid emotionally and socially - which *absolutely causes changes in the brain virtually identical to brain damage* - rarely even gets called out for their shit by their community.

It's almost normalized in our society to traumatize kids emotionally, intellectually, and socially. This has to fucking end.
