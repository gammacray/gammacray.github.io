# I've been practicing for this all my life

Isolating is a hobby and I'm passionate about it. I'm fucking good at it. And it feels good to be good at something everyone else is doing!

Seriously though. 

I think it's amazing that so many millions of people - many for the first time in their lives - get the chance to slow down, focus on things they haven't been able to for decades. I think 2020 is going to result in *years* of amazing writing, art, and music.

2020 is my kinda chaos. I gotta admit it.
