### Maybe a podcast about Empathy? 

Like each episode an anecdote or a series of stories/interviews/analysis of events (current or otherwise) whence empathy was achieved or on display. Cover also how true comedy and laughter is brave, insightful, and full of empathy.

Could be really good. Could take *wildly* different stories from people of all walks of life, all colors and creeds, and situations vastly different from each other but with the common thread of empathy to pull on and tease out into the open. I think it would be a fucking dope theme to riff on. People would love it. And it doesn't have to be all fluffy and woo woo. It can be dark and punchy and real and direct and honest and raw.

Empathy is not a soft cuddly thing like a lot of people envision it. It's fucking messy and painful. And that's what would be amazing to bring out of a project like this. Could do some practice runs with some blog posts. Do some testing on themes and my ability to bring it out.

I'm actually kinda stoked on the idea. This whole focusing on cptsd and mental health stuff is good for now, but similar to that era where I thought I wanted to mod that fucking reddit sub I start to realize that if that's all I focus on, then *that's all I focus on*... and not only that but I end up exposing myself to more Jess's and Lisa's and whoever else. People I don't really want in my life.

Focusing on Empathy would bring more good people around, and I think it would be very attractive. I don't think I'd need to promote the fuck out of it as hard as the niche I'm trying to write in. It's less... risky. But it can be even more dangerous and edgy on other levels. Which is definitely a bonus.

No matter what I choose to focus on, I know my voice is dark and irreverent. Can I *actually* pull off the subject of empathy with that kind of approach? **Only one way to find out!!!**
